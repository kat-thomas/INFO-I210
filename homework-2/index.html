          The Biolizard is a creature in the Sonic the Hedgehog universe, first
          appearing as a boss in Sonic Adventure 2. After defeating the
          Biolizard the first time, it would morph into the Finalhazard and need
          to be fought by the player again, this time as one of the final
          battles in the game. It has reappeared in the games Shadow the
          Hedgehog, Shadow Generations, Sonic Rivals 2, and Sonic Generations
          (Nintendo 3DS).

          The Biolizard is also known as the Protype to the Ulitmate lifeform as
          it was created by Gerald Robotnik before Shadow the Hedgehog. Unlike
          Shadow, it does not contain any DNA from Black Doom. Instead, it is a
          regular salamander that was fused with chaos energy. It was created
          both for the organization G.U.N. and to hopefully find a cure for
          Maria Robotnik's illness. Thus, the salamander was chosen for it's
          regenerative properties. However, the experiments caused the Biolizard
          to grow too big for the researchers to handle. It also did not develop
          past that of a normal animal. This caused the Biolizard project to be
          deemed a failure and the Biolizard to be forced into stasis as G.U.N.
          decided its size and violent tendences were too much of a risk. It
          would stay hidden away until accidentally released by Dr. Eggman fifty
          years later.

          The Biolizard's appearance resembles that of a very, very large
          salamander. It has an orange back with green spots and a dark blue
          underbelly. It is unable to sustain itself, so it needs to be
          connected to external support machines like the one that is on its
          back. It has a pair of front legs, but its back legs are more similar
          to flippers. It is immense in size, and needs to live in a very large
          space.
