## Field Trip Project - Horses in Art

### Project Summary

I noticed that a lot of the paintings in the museum featured horses. This reminded me of games I would play as a kid that allowed me to care for and raise horses. I believe combining these ideas may be a way to teach kids about the different art pieces at the museum while still having fun!

The idea would be that the user selects a horse to train. They get to take it out on walks, feed, bathe, and train it. Throughout this process facts would be shared about the art piece. Eventually it is entered into a show, and a small game and short quiz need to be completed in order to earn a prize!

### Core Webpages

#### Stables:

- includes all of the horses the user can choose from
- perhaps some are locked and need to be earned through winning shows?
- the user selects one horse and takes it to the barn

#### Barn:

- here the user can take care of the horse and raise its stats
- this includes training, feeding, and bathing
- throughout the excercises are fun facts and information about the art piece the horse is from that will help the user in the show

#### Show Room:

- When the horse is of a high enough rank, the user can take it to a show
- here they will play a short quiz that determines how well the horse does on the course (ex. dodges obstacles)
- if the user does well enough they can earn a ribbon! earning a high enough ribbon will help unlock new horses in the stables

### Design Choices

The design would be similar to other horse care games, with a simple "flash game" style that allows for the horses to move around the screen without being too detailed. The user is playing with a model based on the horse in the art piece. They are NOT simply moving around a still shot of the whole paining. The painting is visible in the Stables and the Barn as a label for which horse it is.
