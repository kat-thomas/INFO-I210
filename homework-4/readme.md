# Story Summary

_It is March 20, 1963 for everyone in the world. But for one person, it never stops being March 20, 1963._ The Player is stuck in a Time Loop and has to complete a certain order of events in order to escape. There are hints as to where these items or things could be aquired during the day. The idea would be that the player may need to go through the loop several times before reaching the good ending. There are four true endings in total, three bad and one good.

# Key Takeaways

My key takeaway is that I learned a lot about how for loops and functions work. I also learned a lot about keeping track of variables, as that got kind of confusing. I was able to troubleshoot and improvise problems (like my options being undefined or my "Proceed" button not working) all while creating a fun story! If I was to do this again in the future though, I would have a clearer track of the events and routes I wanted the story to take.
