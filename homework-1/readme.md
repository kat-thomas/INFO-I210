## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

Websites are for informational content that can be viewed, while web applications are programs like Google Docs which allow usesrs to interact with the elements on the page and manipulate the data. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are all code that can be used to build websites.

### VS Code and Extenstions

VS Code is the program I use to write code before it gets pushed to GitHub. There are many extensions that can be used for may different purposes. I have Prettier, Live Server, and Auto Rename Tag to name a few. There's even one for little pets that live in your screen while you code!

### Version Control, Git, and GitHub

GitHub is where I am storing and sharing my code for this class (instead of CyberDuck). Git is a Version Control System that allows me to track my code and the changes I've made. It also lets me work with other people!

### Markdown and Documentation

Markdown is a code to write text (it's how I'm writing this!). It lets me add things like **bold** or _italic_ text and images!

Documentation allows me to keep track of the work I'm doing and what I've learned.
