# Key Takeaways:

Key Takeaways include how to create arrays, for loops, and edit the document from within the javascript file. I also learned more about the functions and how to perform equations in javascript.

# Notes:

- Be sure to include " as ' when inside a string
- an = is necessary for an array
- the for loop will run each process for each number
- because of this, use a function to complete a single step action
- edit the height of an image from within the img tag string, not in a seperate javascript command
